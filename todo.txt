CONTENT-TESTER

- build a static content tester for all exercise types


Dialog

- Time delays
-- 1. between new visual item and audio playback
-- 2. after audio playing and before keyboard apears
-- 3. after finishing all textfields and closing keyboard and before next item
- ! Bug: Layout messed up between inserting items (StackView, colliding constraints with same priority?)
- Implement all 3 exercise types (random)
- Narrator bubbles (without audio)


LTXT

- punctuation compound (TextView2)
- compounds of all views that are not seperated by a whitespace ("don'[t]")
- tabellarisch: same line height
- tabellarisch: find a way to fit both columns on screen
- Gap directly after text (without space) needs connection token


SCR

- Still bug with calculation of line width (see screenshot)


DND

- Retrieve text of correct item from the gap in the script, not the linked vocabulary.



SNAKE

- Requirements:
-- if term is a vocabulary and has a prefix, the prefix letters will be uninteractable and at the beginning of the snake


MATCHER

- Ghost is slightly (2px) smaller in height than normal label, resulting in rearranging visual interruption


LESSON MENU

- line connecting the circles between cells



GENERAL

- ParseHTML all all texts, not only attributed --> use UILabel -parseHTML
- Consolidate exercises!
- Clean Strings from database (e.g. cut trailing spaces, etc)
- Fade-Effect for scrollviews



VOCABULARY

- more variation for 1 words (always snake is boring)
- SNAKE: prefixes



EXERCISE NAVIGATION CONTROLLER

- keep in mind the CONTENT_BOTTOM_MARGIN depends on other measures!



USER DB

- population (once or on every start) necessary at all?




!!!!!!!!! TAKE OUT DEV ALERTS



!!! POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

- LineLayoutView2 in StackView (especially with DialogBubble): trailing (>=right), how does this behave exactly? Seems like right now it produces an okay layout, but i dont understand if fully.
