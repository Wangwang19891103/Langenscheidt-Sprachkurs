Bugs:

- Sprachkurs "ES" before "ESPIC", doesnt get to ESPIC production but reports ES as incomplete
-> added ambiguity support for or_expressionlists at least
- capturing OptionMany objects (seems nodes arent visited twice to close the capture object)
- capturing Group nodes (seems to have to do with ambiguity of "(" and not defining a key in "("..")" )


Optimizations:

- GrammarTree: in scan functions do not create node before first success -> less performance loss


Ideas:

- functions in general. could be prefixed with "_", e.g. "_func(arg1, arg2)"
- function to join tokens with a token as their separator, e.g. _join("String1", "String2", "String3", "|")
- repetitions (option many) with exact numbers, e.g. {"|"}(5)


Support "\"lala\"" (meaning escapes quotes) in grammar files
